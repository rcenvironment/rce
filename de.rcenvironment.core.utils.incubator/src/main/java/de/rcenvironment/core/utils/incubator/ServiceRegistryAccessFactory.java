     * A typical use case is a dynamic GUI element (for example, an RCP dialog or view) that calls this method during creation, registers

     * way, all registered listeners are automatically unregistered.

     * additional restrictions to services fetched from {@link ServiceRegistryAccess#getService()}. In particular, these instances can still
     * be used after {@link ServiceRegistryPublisherAccess#dispose()} has been called on the creating instance.
