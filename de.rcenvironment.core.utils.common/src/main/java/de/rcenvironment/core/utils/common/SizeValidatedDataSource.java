 * Wraps an {@link InputStream} with additional size information, and provides a convenience method to verify that after reading the whole
 * stream, the number of bytes read was actually the intended size defined at the data stream's origin. Note that the full size of the data
 * must be known before creating a {@link SizeValidatedDataSource} instance.
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT: Clients reading from such a stream MUST either verify that they have actually read {@link #getSize()} bytes from the stream,
 * or that #receivedCompletely() is true after reading all of the stream's content (which performs the same check internally for
 * convenience).
 * <p>
 * The design rationale behind this is that clients may start reading from a data stream before all data is known to become available (e.g.
 * when reading from remote systems), but the {@link InputStream} API does not provide a proper way to distinguish between normal and
 * abnormal stream termination.
