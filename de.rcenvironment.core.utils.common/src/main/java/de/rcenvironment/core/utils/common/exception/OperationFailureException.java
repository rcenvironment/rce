/**
 * A generic exception for indicating that a requested operation failed, if the type of the failure is not relevant.
 * <p>
 * For example, if a service's setting is changed through a service method, and that service tries to persist it internally, this write
 * operation may fail. If this happens, then it is irrelevant for the method caller that there was an internal {@link IOException} - the
 * only relevant information is that changing the setting has unexpectedly failed.
 * <p>
 * If you are unsure whether you should use this generic exception or a more specific one (or several specific ones), consider whether the
 * caller can do anything useful based on the type of exception that has occurred.
