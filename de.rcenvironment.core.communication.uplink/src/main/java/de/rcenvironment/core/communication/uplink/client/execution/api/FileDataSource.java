/**
 * Represents a data stream with associated file path and size metadata. As a general contract, receivers of such an object SHOULD close the
 * data stream after reading from it, even if an error occurs while processing it. Infrastructure code, however, SHOULD NOT take this
 * behavior as guaranteed. For streams that are not specific to files, for example when no name/path association is needed or appropriate,
 * the generic {@link SizeValidatedDataSource} superclass should be used instead.
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT: Clients reading from such a stream MUST either verify that they have actually read {@link #getSize()} bytes from the stream,
 * or that #receivedCompletely() is true after reading all of the stream's content (which performs the same check internally for
 * convenience).
 * <p>
 * The design rationale behind is this that clients may start reading from the data stream before it is known to be complete, and the
 * {@link InputStream} API does not provide a proper way to distinguish between normal and abnormal stream termination.
