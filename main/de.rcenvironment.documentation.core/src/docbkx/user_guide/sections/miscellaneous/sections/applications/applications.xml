	<title>Preliminary Aircraft Design: Design of a short- to medium-range aircraft</title>
	<para>From a paper presented at DLRK 2012: "Application of a distributed
		MDAO framework to the design of a short- to medium-range aircraft", E.
		Moerland, T. Zill, B. Nagel, H. Spangenberg, H. Schumann, P. Zamov
	</para>
	<para>"The workflow consists of an initiation part, in which the initial
		aircraft model is generated, a high-lift concept and engine are added
		and the overall aerodynamic polars corresponding to the configuration
		are calculated. All the data is cumulatively stored in the CPACS data
		exchange format and forwarded to the iterative part. Herein, the
		initially calculated wing component masses using VAMPzero are updated
		using tools of higher-fidelity level. The connection to systems
		pre-design is established and a synthesis is performed. The
		calculation is continued until the aircraft masses are converged
		(i.e.: all snowball effects of changing individual component masses
		are incorporated)."
