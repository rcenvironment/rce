	<title>Remote Tool and Workflow Access</title>
	<para>RCE provides an interface that allows external applications to access and run single tools or
		complete workflows within RCE instances. This allows existing applications to make use of
		RCE's features (like network distribution, data management, logging, ...) when integrating
		the application itself is not possible or desirable. For example, applications that are
		based on frequent user interaction are not a good fit for being run as part of an automated
		workflow, but may still want to use some of RCE's features.</para>
	<para>This section describes the Remote Access feature from an end-user's perspective. Using
		scripts and templates contained in the RCE distribution, this will guide you through the
		creation of a simple example, which you can expand to build your own solutions.</para>
	<sect2>
		<title>Basic Concepts</title>
		<para>The basic idea of the Remote Access interface is that the external application opens an SSH
			connection to RCE, and initiates the tool or workflow execution via text commands. Input
			and output data, as well as log files, are transfered using SCP. To demonstrate this
			interface, and how to interact with it, example script files are provided for Windows
			and Linux. This documentation explains how to set up and use these scripts.</para>
		<para>Note that these scripts are not the Remote Access interface itself, but only prototype
			examples of how to use it. Native command-line tools and system libraries (e.g. Windows
			.dll and Linux .so files) are under development, and will be available soon.</para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2>
		<title>Prerequisites</title>
		<para>Except for RCE (and the Java installation it needs to run), you need just one more piece of
			software to use the Remote Tool Access example. <phrase os="windows">On Windows, you
				need to have "Putty" (an SSH client) installed on your system.</phrase>
			<phrase os="linux">On Linux, the "sshpass" package is required. (This assumes that "ssh"
				and "scp" commands are already present on the system.)</phrase></para>
		<note>
			<para os="windows">You can download Putty (free of charge) from
					<uri>http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</uri>. If you install it
				into the default location, there is nothing more to do. If you choose a different
				installation path, you need to adjust the Putty path in the run.bat file described
				later.</para>
			<para os="linux">To install the "sshpass" package, check if your Linux distribution's package
				manager provides it. On Debian, Ubuntu or Mint systems, for example, you can install
				it by running the command <code>sudo apt-get install sshpass</code> in a terminal.
				On other distributions, like CentOS or SUSE, you may need to compile and install it
				from source. To do so, download the source from
					<uri>http://sourceforge.net/projects/sshpass/files/sshpass/1.05/</uri>, unpack
				it, and run the standard <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
					install</code> sequence as root. (Please note that these steps are only required
				for the shell script examples to work. It is not required for the Remote Access
				interface itself.)</para>

		<title>Tool vs. Workflow Execution</title>
		<para>In RCE 5.0.0, the "remote access" feature was able to invoke a single integrated tool.
			Starting with RCE 5.1.0, arbitrary user-defined workflows can be executed. The following
			sections describe each approach separately.</para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2>
		<title>Setting up the Single Tool Execution Example</title>
		<para>These steps will guide you through the configuration of an integrated tool, and will show
			you how to access it using the provided example scripts. Using this example, you will be
			able to easily integrate your own text-based tools into RCE and invoke them using the
			Remote Access interface.</para>

		<title>Building Your Own Remote Access Workflow</title>
		<para>After running the example/template workflow as described in the previous section, you
			can proceed to building your own actual workflow.</para>
		<para>As described above, open the "Remote_Workflow_Access_Template" workflow file. You will
			see an Input Provider on the left side with two outputs: one Directory and one
			ShortText. On the right side, there is an Output Provider with a single Directory input.
			These are the points where the Remote Workflow Access feature sends the provided input
			files (as a Directory) and parameters (as a ShortText) into your workflow, and collects
			the final output files (as a Directory). You should leave these two components
			unchanged, and place your workflow logic between them. The Script component in the
			middle is just a placeholder - unless you need a Script component anyway, you can just
			delete it.</para>
		<para>There are two basic approaches to building your workflow:<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Either you start with the template, and build your workflow between the
						two standard components. This is straight-forward, but means that you cannot
						test run the workflow from the RCE GUI (as the Input Provider will fail),
						but have to use the Remote Access feature to test it.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The other approach is to build your workflow normally, where you add an
						Input Provider and Output Writer with the same outputs and inputs as the
						ones in the template (but with standard configuration values). You can then
						test (and if needed, modify) your workflow from the GUI until it behaves as
						it should. Then, mark all components <emphasis>except</emphasis>  the Input
						Provider and Output writer in your workflow, and select "Copy" from the
						right-click menu. Switch to the template file, click an empty area, and
						select "Paste" from the right-click menu. Then, connect the two template
						components (Input Provider and Output Writer) as in your original
						workflow.</para>
					<note>
						<para>(Advanced Usage) You can also build your workflow in the template
							file, add your own Input Provider and Output Writer, and use the new
							"Enable/Disable Component" feature to toggle between them for testing
							and Remote Access usage. As this requires some helper components to
							work, this is not recommended for your first example, but may be a
							useful trick to keep in mind.</para>
					</note>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist></para>
		<para>After you have finished building your workflow, the process of publishing and
			executing it is the same as described above for the unmodified template file. Please
			note that publishing your workflow for remote execution automatically creates an
			(invisible) copy of it. Modifications you make to your workflow file are not published
			right away. Once you have made the changes you want to publish, run the same "ra-admin
			publish-wf" command again to update the published version.<note>
				<para>Tip: To repeat a previous command, presse the "up arrow" key in the Command
					Console window.</para>
