    <title>Integration of External Tools</title>
    <sect2>
        <title>Basic Concepts</title>
        <para>The Tool Integration concept of RCE is used to integrate external tools for
            calculation or other things into RCE and use them in a workflow as a component. The
            tools must fulfill some requirements:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>The tool must be callable via command line</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>It must have a non-interactive mode which is called via command line</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Input for the tool must be provided trough command line arguments or
                    files</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>If these requirements are fulfilled, a configuration file that is used for the
            integration can be created. </para>
        <para>This can be done with the help of an integration wizard if you use RCE with a graphical user interface.
            This wizard can be found in the menu <emphasis role="italic">File -> Integrate a
                Tool</emphasis>. Everything that is needed for an integration will show up in this
            wizard. Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*). When the wizard is finished
            and everything is correct, the integrated tool will automatically show up in the
            workflow editor palette.</para>
        <para>
            <note>
                <para>The wizard has a dynamic help, which is shown by clicking on the question mark
                    on the bottom left or by pressing F1. It will guide you through every page of
                    the wizard.</para>
            </note>
        </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
        <title>Copying of Integrated Tools</title>
        <para> When a component is created in the integration wizard, a configuration file is
            created.</para>
        <para>All configuration files from the tool integration are stored in the directory</para>
        <para><code>&lt;profile folder>/integration/tools/</code></para>
        <para>In this directory, there is a separation between different kinds of integration
            realized through one subdirectory for each. The <code>common</code> folder is always
            existent.</para>
        <para>In these subdirectory, the integrated tools are stored, again separated through a
            subdirectory for each. The name of the directory equals the name of integration of the
            tool. </para>
        <para>If a tool integration should be copied to another RCE instance or another machine, the
            directory of the tool must be copied, containing a <code>configuration.json</code> and
            some optional files. It must be put in the equivalent integration type directory of the
            target RCE instance. After that, RCE automatically reads the new folder and if
            everything is valid, the tool will be integrated right away.</para>
        <sect3>
            <title>Publishing a Component on a Server Instance in Headless Mode</title>
            <para>An integrated tool on a server is not neccessarily visible for other user in the
                same network. Publishing it means to make it available for all others, but they are
                not allowed to change the tool's integration. If a component should be published,
                the <code>published.conf</code> file in the integration kind subdirectory must be
                edited. In this file, the tool's directory name (or absolute path) must be written
                in a single line. After saving the file, RCE again reads the file automatically and
                the component will be published in the network.</para>

                            would like to allow users of your tool to choose that the temp directory
                            won’t be deleted at all after workflow execution, check the property
                                <emphasis role="italic">Never delete working
                                directory(ies)</emphasis>. Not to delete the working directory can
                            be very useful for users for debugging purposes, at least if they have
                            access to the server’s file system. But this option can result in disc
                            space issues as the amount required grows continuously with each
                            workflow execution. It is recommended to check that option during
                            integrating the tool and uncheck it before publishing the tool. If you
                            like to publish your tool to the entire network right after the
                            integration, check <emphasis role="italic">Publish component after

            <para>The way to integrate a CPACS tool on a server running RCE in headless mode is as
                follows: Perform the steps to integrate a CPACS tool on a client instance and make
                sure that the path of the CPACS tool configured on the <emphasis role="italic"
                    >Launch Settings</emphasis> page (step 8) matches the absolute tool path on your
                server system. Afterwards, you will find the configuration files inside your rce
                profile folder at the following location:</para>
            <para><code>/integration/tools/cpacs/[YourToolName]</code></para>
            <para>Copy the folder <code>[YourToolName]</code> to the same location inside the
                profile folder running with your headless server instance. Edit the file
                    <code>published.conf</code> in the cpacs directory by adding your tool´s
                directory name as a single line. If the server instance is already running, your
                tool will be available immediately after saving the file (cf. section "Publishing a
                component in headless mode").</para>
