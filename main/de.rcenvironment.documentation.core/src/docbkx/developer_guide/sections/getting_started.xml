        <para><ulink url="https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/workspacemechanic/">Workspace
                Mechanic</ulink> is an Eclipse plugin that automates common settings in local
            workspaces. For RCE, the most important settings are the Java code formatting rules and
            templates. Other settings are provided for convenience, like disabling the console
            output limit, or showing line numbers in the editor.</para>
        <para>Configuring Workspace Mechanic consists of copying a set of "rule" files to a location
            where the plugin can find them. There are two options for this:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>If you want to apply the rules to all Eclipse installations on your

                        directory; by default, this is <code os="windows"

            Using any SVN tool, check out
                <code>https://svn.sistec.dlr.de/svn/rce/new/meta/eclipse/mechanic</code> into a
            sub-folder called "<code>checkout</code>" within it. (Note that the actual name of the
            sub-folder is not relevant; adapt if you like.) This sub-folder now contains common
            rules on its top level, and optional or experimental rules in sub-folders. Copy all
            common rules to the parent folder (the one you started in), and add any optional rules
            that you want to apply as well. (TODO add and describe batch/shell files for
            this.)</para>
        <para>The next time you open a workspace, Workspace Mechanic should pick up these rule files
            and show a notice asking if it should apply them. See the plugin's <ulink
