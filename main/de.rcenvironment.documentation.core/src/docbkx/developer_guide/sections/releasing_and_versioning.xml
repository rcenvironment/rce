		<title>Overview: The Release and Versioning Process</title>
		<para>Creating an RCE release and preparing for the next one is a process
			that can be split into four distinct steps (or phases):
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Trunk preparations - actions that take place in the development
					trunk before the release branch is split off.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Release candidate building and testing - creation of the release
					branch, building RCs on the CI server, and applying fixes if necessary.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Final release - creating and publishing the final release build, SCM
					tagging, posting announcements etc.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Post-release actions - preparing the trunk for the next release.
				</para>

			<title>Upgrading Version Numbers (and Verification)</title>
			<para>
				By convention, the version numbers of all plugins and features are
				increased in the trunk immediately
				<emphasis>after</emphasis>
				a release has been performed. This way, every snapshot build is associated
				with the upcoming release (e.g., all snapshot builds after the 2.5.0
				release are named "2.5.1.xxx_SNAPSHOT").
			</para>
			<para> The version upgrade process of RCE Core is mostly automated: <itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para> Open a shell or command window in
							"/de.rcenvironment.core/maven/utils/" and run the appropriate
							"upgrade-core" script for your platform (.bat on Windows, .sh on Linux).
							Usage: <cmdsynopsis>
								<command> upgrade-core</command>
								<arg choice="req">
									<replaceable>old core version</replaceable>
								</arg>
								<arg choice="req">
									<replaceable>new core version</replaceable>
								</arg>
							</cmdsynopsis></para>
						<para> Example: <code>upgrade-core 2.5.0 2.5.1</code>
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para> Build the core repository locally to verify that the build setup is
							consistent: <itemizedlist>
								<listitem>
									<para>(Option 1) To build from Eclipse, use the launch files in
										"/de.rcenvironment/eclipse/build/using default (release or
										snapshot) remote repositories". The best way to ensure
										proper configuration of the local code base is the "RCE 6.x
										- product.singleStep (snapshot).launch" configuration, as it
										uses the same setup as the CI build on Jenkins. </para>
								</listitem>
								<listitem>
									<para>(Option 2) To build with plain Maven, open a shell in
										"/de.rcenvironment/maven/initial" and run the command "mvn
										clean package --Drce.maven.buildVariant=product.singleStep". </para>
								</listitem>
							</itemizedlist></para>
						<para>Note that both options will only work if you have network access to the
							"software.dlr.de" host that provides RCE Platform releases. If this is
							not the case, build a local RCE Platform repository and use the "RCE 6.x
							- product.singleStep (using local platform repository).launch"
							configuration from eclipse. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Create a Mantis issue "release x.y.z" for the new version if it does
							not exist yet (usually, it won't). </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Commit the changes under this issue. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para> Verify the CI/Jenkins build: <itemizedlist>
								<listitem>
									<para>(Option 1) Manually trigger a snapshot build using the
										Jenkins job "RCE_Tycho_Trunk_Snapshot_RCE_CoreRepo_USDD" and
										check that it completes normally. </para>
								</listitem>
							</itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
								<listitem>
									<para>(Option 2) Keep an eye on the standard periodic builds
										(nightly, "onCommit", ..) and see if they complete normally.
										IMPORTANT: This is ONLY appropriate if you are
										around/available for handling possible problems! </para>
								</listitem>

		<title>Creating a maintenance/hotfix release</title>
		<para>
			When creating a release that is not based on the current development trunk,
			the release process is slightly different. Such ""maintenance or "hotfix"
			releases must
			<emphasis>always</emphasis>
			be derived from a stable release.
		</para>
		<para>
			To create a new release based on a previously-released version:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a release branch (similar to a normal release) by copying
						the SVN release tag folder.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Check out this release branch to your local machine.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						As in step 4 of the standard process, upgrade the local version numbers,
						create a Mantis issue for the release and commit the version changes to
						it. Note the change in ordering: in a standard release, version numbers
						are upgraded in the trunk
						<emphasis>after</emphasis>
						the release; in a maintenance/hotfix release, they are upgraded
						<emphasis>before</emphasis>
						the release, inside the release branch.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Apply and commit the fixes or changes you want in the release; if
						you want to include specific trunk changes, consider transfering them by
						using diff patches.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Perform standard step 2 (RC building and testing).
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>When everything is tested, perform standard step 3 (final release).
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						If changes were made in the release branch that should also be in the
						trunk, merge them back
						<emphasis>selectively</emphasis>
						. Unlike a normal release, you cannot simply merge all branch changes
						back to trunk; take special care not to mix up version numbers when
						merging.
					</para>
