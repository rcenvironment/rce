The "lib/maven/autoCopy.flag" files in several projects trigger the automatic
copying of all Maven dependency JARs into the lib/maven folder of that project.
This mechanism is intended for for embedding JARs into OSGi bundles without 
putting them under source control (where common binaries don't belong).

Note that the "lib/maven" target folder location is hard-coded in a parent 
POM; placing this file in any other location will have no effect.
