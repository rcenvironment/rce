        <title>Usage</title>
        <para>With this wizard, you can edit an existing active or inactive integration
            configuration. You can select one of the integration configurations from the list of
            configurations that have been detected, but you can also load a valid configuration from
            disk. The other pages of the wizard will be filled with the content of the
            configuration. After updating your component, it could be necessary to reopen your
            workflow editor (to get the correct information in the properties tab), but if you
            execute it without doing that it will always use the updated values. If you change
            something on the inputs or outputs, unfortunately at the moment you have to remove the
            instances of your tool in a configured workflow and put it back in. </para>
