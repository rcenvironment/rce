		<title>Usage</title>
		<para>Using the XPathChooser, it is possible to select content of an Xml-File. A tree, symbolizing the Xml-File, 
		is shown in the table. By selecting an element, the label below is updated and displays the current path. The last two
		columns are used to choose attributes. The attribute name can be selected via the column “UID Name”. In the column 
		“Values”, the proper value can be selected. Use a double-click on an element to expand or fold the tree.
		The chosen XPath will be written in the text field of the window, in which the XPathChooser has been opened originally.
		Using this text field, new paths can be created. Add a slash and the name of the node that shall be created to the existing
		path. The new path will be added during the workflow run. 
			<note>New XPaths can only be generated within the inputs tab. Using the outputs tab will cause an error.</note>
