 * Abstract representation of equivalence groups of {@link Component}s that access permissions are assigned to. In other words, this
 * selector defines which {@link Component}s are "the same" as far as the authorization system is concerned.
 * 
 * Currently, the defining aspect of {@link Component}s is their component id; this means that different versions (more precisely,
 * {@link ComponentRevision}s) of a component share the same permission settings at the moment. This is intentional, as it is assumed that
 * this is more convenient and intuitive for end users than a more fine-grained assignment. If this assumption turns out wrong, however,
 * then this abstraction is the place to change it.
