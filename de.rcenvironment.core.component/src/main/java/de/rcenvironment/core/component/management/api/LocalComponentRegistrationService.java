 * <li>Keeping track of local component installations
 * <li>Fetching the initial authorization settings from the {@link AuthorizationService} and subscribing to updates
 * <li>Combining component registration data and authorization settings to a consistent model

 * 
 * Regarding terminology: We say that a ComponentAuthorizationSelector is orphaned if it does not refer to any currently available
 * component. This may happen if the user removes an integration that was still published.
