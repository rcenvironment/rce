/**
 * Callback interface. Called on certain component lifecycle changes.
 * 
 * @author Doreen Seider
 * 
 * Note: Communication between a workflow controller and its components is done with RPCs. E.g., if a workflow controller wants all
 * of its components to start, it calls their start method and waits for certain callbacks which announce certain states. It
 * continues not before all of the states are reached.
 * This class is used to get notified if the components reached certain states, e.g. all of them are finished.
 * 
 * In a future implementation I would consider to move from the RPC-based approach to a messaging-based approach for the
 * workflow-component communication. I would expect to get cleaner code without so many waiting implemented in the workflow engine
 * code which is error-prone. --seid_do
