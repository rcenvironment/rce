/**
 * The initial interface for accessing and controlling a {@link Toolkit} instance.
 * 
 * The main purpose of the RCE Toolkit is to provide a consistent set of services within a JVM. It is currently used to provide reusable
 * services for distributed applications, but could be used to provide all kinds of services. It is explicitly possible to use multiple
 * {@link Toolkit} instances within the same JVM without interference.
 * 
 * The basic building blocks of a {@link Toolkit} setup are modules, which define a subset of services, and the {@link ToolkitFactory} which
 * provides dependency injection support for the common task of consuming services as part of implementing another service.
