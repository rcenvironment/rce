# RCE's Command Console

RCE features a command console. +
This command console is accessible via the command console view in RCE's desktop mode or via SSH.
Commands consist of one or two tokens e.g. "im" for one token and "im list" for two tokens.
Beside the user commands that are documented in RCE's User Guide, there are developer commands supporting additional developer features.
A list of all developer commands is shown in the following section.

## Commands [[commands]]

Commands are structured in groups.
A command group is defined by the first token of a command.
This means, that commands like "im info" and "im list" are in the same command group.
Some command groups like "stats" consist only of a single command.
For each group there is a table explaining all the related commands.

## Parameters [[parameters]]

RCE commands can use three different types of parameters.
These are <<positional, positional>> parameters, <<named, named>> parameters and <<flag, flags>>.
Positional and named parameters take at least one value.
However, some of them also take a list parameters.
List parameters are denoted by three dots after their name in the tables above, while parameters that take only a single value do not have it, e.g. *<parameter...>*.
Multiple values for list parameters are entered using comma separation, e.g. *value0, value1, value2*.

*_Positional [[positional]]_*

Positional parameters must be entered immediately after a command.
The order of the parameters must be followed for the command to process the parameters correctly.
After all positional parameters have been entered, other types of parameters can be entered.

*_Named [[named]]_*

Named parameters are optional parameters.
The command input of these parameters always start with a double dash, e.g. *--name*.
The value must be specified after the parameter name.

*_Flag [[flag]]_*

Command flags are used to modify the operation of a command.
They are always optional.
Flags start with a dash or a double dash.
A single dash is used for flags consisting of only a single character, e.g. *-a*.
Double dash is used for flags composed of more than one letter, e.g. *--all*.
This long form is more descriptive and is therefore easier to understand.
Command flags can have both long and short form, e.g. *-a* and *--all*, which do not differ in execution.

## Documentation generation

Part of this documentation is automatically generated.
This is done by executing the *help --asciidoc* command in RCE.
The output of this command has to be copied to the file *de.rcenvironment.documentation.core/src/asciidoc/generated/user-commands.ad*.
This can be done by using the *saveto* command.
