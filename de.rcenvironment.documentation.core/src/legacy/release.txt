= "RCE Core" and distribution release guideline =

This file describes the release and versioning process for the "RCE Core" repository.

Note that in 2.5.x, the "standard" and "example" component groups are built as part of 
the core repository, and are therefore upgraded and released along with it. This will 
probably change in a future release.


== Creating and tagging a release ==

This section describes how to create a release from the current development trunk.
The end result is a self-contained p2 repository in
"/de.rcenvironment.repositories.rce.core/target/repository". It contains both the 
generated plugins and features, as well as all required plugins and features pulled 
in from the "RCE Platform" p2 repository used for the build. As of RCE 2.5.x, the 
"fileset" features used by distributions are also contained in this repository.

Note that this guide assumes you have access to the DLR Nexus at repo.sc.dlr.de and
the p2 repository server updates.sc.dlr.de.  

=== Preparations and Verification ===

 * Make sure that you are working with a clean checkout of 
   "https://svn.sistec.dlr.de/svn/rce/new/rce/trunk". It is recommended to create 
   a fresh checkout, or having a workspace that is only used for release preparations.

 * Make sure that all parent POMs references in the build scope point to a release 
   version (no "-SNAPSHOT" suffix). You can verify this in Eclipse by performing a 
   full-text file search for "-SNAPSHOT" in *.xml and *.pom files; it should come up 
   empty. Also check the log output of all build attempts. If a snapshot version 
   is used, a line like this will appear, as snapshot versions are retrieved from the 
   Maven repository on every build:
   
   "Downloading: http://repo.sc.dlr.de/nexus/content/repositories/rce-public-2.5/de/
   rcenvironment/de.rcenvironment.common.parent.osgi/2.5.1-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml"

   If a POM parent points to a snapshot version, and you know that there is an 
   appropriate stable version, change it as necessary (described below). If you are
   unsure what version is correct, ask the parent POM maintainer (R. Mischke).
   
 * Run a local test product build using the Eclipse launch configuration
   "RCE - test core repository release (using configured platform release)"
   in the "/de.rcenvironment.repositories.rce.core/eclipse/" folder. This uses the
   same Maven configuration as a release candidate (RC) build on Jenkins.
   
   * If version errors occur, the distribution is probably not updated the the new 
     core version yet. Check the section "Upgrading a distribution build" below.
   
 * If this build is successful, run a test product build using the launch configuration
   "RCE - standard edition - test release build (using local core build)"
   in the "/de.rcenvironment.repositories.rce.main/eclipse/" folder. This uses the
   same Maven configuration as a release builds on Jenkins.
   
 * Start the generated product; note that you should probably copy or move it from 
   its output folder ("target/repository/products/...") to a folder with a shorter 
   path length first (see Mantis #7459).
   
 * Open "Help > About RCE > Installation Details", expand all sub-trees and verify that 
   all RCE version numbers (platform/core/product) are correct. Also verify the release 
   type suffixes: The platform features should have release versions (no "SNAPSHOT"
   or "RC" suffix); the core and product features should all have a "RC" (release 
   candidate) suffix.
   
 After these verifications (and of course, committing all related changes), the RCE core
 trunk is ready for release branching.
   
=== Release branching and CI release candidate ===

 * Create the release SVN tag from trunk; see existing tags for naming conventions.
 
 * Build and deploy the release with the "RCE_Tycho_Versioned_Release_Platform_Repo_USDD" 
   Jenkins job:
  * add the new SVN tag path as a "FULL_SVN_TAG" option (on top of the list)
  * run the job with this option   

 * (to be continued)

== Upgrading the version numbers == 

By convention, the version numbers of all plugins and features are increased in the 
trunk immediately *after* a release has been performed. This way, every snapshot build 
is associated with the upcoming release (e.g., snapshot builds after 2.5.0 RELEASE are 
numbered 2.5.1 SNAPSHOT).

The version upgrade process of RCE Core is mostly automated:

 * Open a shell or command window in "/de.rcenvironment.core/maven/utils/" and run the 
   appropriate "upgrade-core" script for your platform (.bat on Windows, .sh on Linux).
   
   Usage: "upgrade-core <old core version> <new core version>"
   Example: "upgrade-core 2.5.0 2.5.1"  

 * Build the core repository locally to verify that the build setup is consistent:
 
   * (Option 1) To build from Eclipse, use the launch files in 
     "/de.rcenvironment.repositories.rce.core/eclipse". The best way to ensure proper
     configuration of the local code base is the "RCE - test core repository release 
     (using configured platform release).launch" configuration, as it uses the same
     setup as the CI build on Jenkins.
     
   * (Option 2) To build with plain Maven, open a shell in "/de.rcenvironment.
     repositories.rce.core/" and run the command "mvn clean package 
     -Drce.maven.platformRepositoryUrlRoot=
     http://updates.sc.dlr.de/eclipse/rce/platform/releases/" (no whitespace after
     the "=" sign).

   Note that both options will only work if you have network access to the 
   "updates.sc.dlr.de" host that provides RCE Platform releases. If this is not the 
   case, build a local RCE Platform repository and use the "RCE - build core 
   repository (using local platform repository).launch" configuration from eclipse.
   
 * Create a Mantis issue "release x.y.z" for the new version if it does not exist yet
   (usually, it won't).
   
 * Commit the changes under this issue.  

 * Verify the CI/Jenkins build:
 
   * (Option 1) Manually trigger a snapshot build using the Jenkins job  
     "RCE_Tycho_Trunk_Snapshot_RCE_CoreRepo_USDD" and check that it completes normally.
   
   * (Option 2) Keep an eye on the standard periodic builds (nightly, "onCommit", ..) 
     and see if they complete normally. IMPORTANT: This is ONLY appropriate if you are 
     around/available for handling possible problems!


== Upgrading to a new version of "RCE Platform" ==

 * If the platform repository version has changed, run the "upgrade-platform-reference"  
   script in the same directory.
   
   Usage: "upgrade-platform-reference <old platform version> <new platform version>"
   Example: "upgrade-platform-reference 2.5.0 2.5.3"
   
 * Follow the commit/verify process as described in the "version number upgrade" 
   section above.


== Upgrading to a another version of "RCE Common Parent" ==

 * Replace the parent POM version in "/de.rcenvironment.core/maven/coreParent.pom", for
   example from 

    <parent>
        <groupId>de.rcenvironment</groupId>
        <artifactId>de.rcenvironment.common.parent.osgi</artifactId>
        <version>2.5.0</version>
    </parent>

   to 
   
    <parent>
        <groupId>de.rcenvironment</groupId>
        <artifactId>de.rcenvironment.common.parent.osgi</artifactId>
        <version>2.5.1-SNAPHOT</version>
    </parent>
    
   If you are unsure what version to use, ask the parent POM maintainer (R. Mischke).
    
 * Follow the commit/verify process as described in the "version number upgrade" 
   section above.


== Upgrading a distribution build ==

 * If necessary, adapt the "RCE Common" parent POM in 
   "/de.rcenvironment.repositories.<distribution>/maven/productParent.pom".
   
 * Change the POM versions in ".../pom.xml" and ".../maven/repository/pom.xml".

 * Change the "internal.coreRepository.urlVersionSuffix" property in 
   ".../pom.xml" and ".../maven/productParent.pom" 
   to the new core version.
   
   (TODO 3.0.0: try to reduce this to one location)
   
 * Change the <product .. version="x.y.z"> number in 
   ".../maven/repository/rce_default.product". 

 * Change all feature and fileset versions in ".../
   maven/repository/category.xml" to the new core version.
