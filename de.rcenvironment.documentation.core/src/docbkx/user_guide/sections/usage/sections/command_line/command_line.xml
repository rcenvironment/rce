							<entry>
								<para>Executes one or more shell commands defined by &lt;command string>. For the list of
									available commands, refer to the command shell
									documentation<!--TODO add link-->. This argument is usually used
									together with --headless to run RCE in batch mode. Multiple
									commands can be chained within &lt;command string> by separating
									them with " ; " (note the spaces); each command is completed
									before the next is started.</para>
								<para>You can use the "<code>stop</code>" command at the end of the
									command sequence to shut down RCE after the other commands have
									been executed. However, any error during execution of these
									commands will cancel the sequence, and prevent the
										"<code>stop</code>" command from being executed. To ensure
									shut down at the end of the command sequence, use the
										<code>--batch</code> option instead of
									"<code>--exec</code>". </para>
								<para>As an example, <code>rce --headless --exec "wf run example.wf ; stop"</code> will
									execute the "example.wf" workflow in headless mode and then shut
									down RCE. However, if the workflow fails to start, RCE will keep
									running, as the "<code>stop</code>" command is never executed.
									To attempt execution of the workflow file, but then always shut
									down regardless of the outcome,  use <code>rce --batch "wf run
										example.wf"</code> instead.</para>

		<title>Command Shell</title>
		<para>RCE provides an integrated shell (sometimes referred to as "console") for executing
			commands. It can be accessed in three different ways:<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Start RCE with the "-console" command-line option, or add "-console" to
						the rce.ini file before starting; this will open an OSGi console window. Due
						to the nature of an OSGi console, all RCE commands must be prefixed with
						"rce". For example, type "rce help" to show the available commands.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para><emphasis>Deprecated: </emphasis>Start RCE with the "-console &lt;port>"
						command-line option; this will accept telnet OSGi console sessions on that
						port. As with the "-console" option, RCE commands must be prefixed with
						"rce" (for example, type "rce help").</para>
					<para>Note that this option is <emphasis>insecure</emphasis>, as there is no
						authentication nor encryption, so it should only be used in fully trusted
						networks. Whenever possible, use the SSH console (see below) instead
						.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Configure SSH access. To do so, refer to Section Configuration Parameters. After RCE has
						started, you can access the shell on the configured port with a standard SSH
						client. On Windows systems, the "putty" software works well as a
						client.</para>
					<para>As this option creates a pure RCE shell (as opposed to the OSGi consoles
						created above), you can enter RCE commands without a prefix - for example,
						just type "help" to list the available commands. Note that to avoid
						confusion, adding a "rce" prefix still works, but it is not
						necessary.</para>
				</listitem>

								<para>The "--delete" option defines the deletion behavior after workflow completion.
									Deleting a workflow deletes all of its files in the data
									management and releases certain resources that may or may not be
									used after it has finished, for example data to be visualized in

									"onfinished": The workflow is deleted if it terminates in state

									otherwise it is left unchanged for inspection.</para>

									much as possible, which is intended to simplify scripted calls
									of this command. The first line printed will either be the
									workflow's assigned id if the start was successful, or a text
									starting with <code>"Error "</code> if the workflow could not be
									started. If (and only if) the start was successful, a second

		<title>Configuration Placeholder Value Files</title>
	<para>Some workflow components use placeholders for configuration
		values. The values for the placeholders are defined at workflow start.
		When executing workflows from the command line (e.g. in headless or
		batch mode), the placeholder's values must be defined in a file, which
		will be passed to the command with the -p option. Placeholder value
		files have following format:</para>
		<para><code>{ </code></para>
		<para><code> &lt;component id>/&lt;component version> : {</code></para>
		<para><code>      &lt;configuration placeholder id> : &lt;configuration value></code></para>
		<para><code>  }</code></para>
		<para><code> &lt;component id>/&lt;component version>/&lt;component instance name> :
				{</code></para>
		<para><code>      &lt;configuration placeholder id> : &lt;configuration value></code></para>
		<para><code>  }</code></para>
		<para><code>}</code></para>
		<para>
			<note>
				<para>Every id and every value must be in enclosed in double quotes ("...").</para>
			</note>
		</para>
		<para>The <code>component id</code> is the id string of a component (e.g.
				de.rcenvironment.script), the <code>component version</code> is the version of the
				component that is used in the workflow (e.g. 3.4).</para>
		<para> There are two ways of defining values for configuration placeholders: per component type and
				per component instance. When defined per component type, the id and version must be
				specified (e.g. "de.rcenvironment.script/3.4"). When defined per component instance
				the component id, component version, and the name of the component in the workflow
				must be specified (e.g. "de.rcenvironment.script/3.4/MyScript"). In both cases, the
					<code>configuration placeholder id</code>, which is the name of the
				configuration placeholder, and the actual <code>configuration value</code> must be
				specified.</para>
		<para>Component instance values override component type values.</para>
		<para>
			<note>
				<para>It is possible to mix component type and component instance values.</para>
			</note>
		</para>
		<para>Below is an example placeholder value file, which defines one placeholder value (component type) for the
				script component, one placeholer value (component type) for the input provider component and
				a placeholder value (component instance) for a specified input provider component of the workflow:</para>
		<para><code>{</code></para>
