    <para> RCE (Remote Component Environment) is an open source software that helps engineers,
        scientists and others to create, manage and execute complex calculation and simulation
        workflows. A workflow in RCE consists of components with predefined inputs and outputs
        connected to each other. A component can be a simulation tool, a tool for data access, or a
        user-defined script. Connections define which data flows from one component to another.
        There are predefined components with common functionalities, like an optimizer or a cluster
        component. Additionally, users can integrate their own tools. RCE instances can be connected
        with each other. Components can be executed locally or on remote instances of RCE (if the
        component is configured to allow this). Using these building blocks, use cases for complex
        distributed applications can be solved with RCE. </para>
