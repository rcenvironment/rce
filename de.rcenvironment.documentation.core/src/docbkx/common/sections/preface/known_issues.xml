            <title>KDE on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7</title>
        <para>On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 with KDE 4, RCE (like any other Eclipse-based
            application) can cause a segmentation fault at startup. If you encounter such an issue,
            you can try choosing a different GTK2 theme:</para>

         <title>KDE with Oxygen</title>
        <para>On Unix Systems using KDE as desktop environment and Oxygen as theme it can happen that RCE crashes when certain GUI elements are shown.
            It is a known issue in the theme Oxygen and happens on other Eclipse-based applications as well. If you encounter such an issue, 
            please choose a different theme like "Raleigh" or "Adwaita".</para>

        <title>Jython scripts are executed sequentially</title>
        <para>The Script component can use Jython for the evaluation of scripts and the pre- and
                postprocessing of integrated tools always uses Jython. Due to a known bug in the
                Jython implementation it is not possible to execute several Jython instances in
                parallel. Therefore, the execution will be done sequentially. If several Script
                components should be executed in parallel, Python should be used  instead. </para>

        <title>32-bit Java is not supported</title>
        <para>Running RCE with a 32-bit Java Runtime Environment doesn't work. On some operating
                systems an error dialog will be displayed in this case, on some other systems
                nothing will happen at all. Therefore, always make sure a 64-bit Java Runtime
                Environment is used to run RCE.</para>
