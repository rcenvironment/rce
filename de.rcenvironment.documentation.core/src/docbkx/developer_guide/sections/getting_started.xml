                    <para>Currently, Oracle JDK 8.x is the reference development platform. In the

                        Windows and Linux to simplify licensing issues. OpenJDK has already been
                        successfully tested in version 8 and 11, on Windows and Linux, for
                        development and building. Note that automated JUnit test execution as part
                        of the build process is currently only possible with 8.x versions of the
                        JDK; this will be extended to JDK 11 soon.</para>

                        an appropriate precompiled target platform release. Follow these steps to

            workspaces. For RCE, the most important settings are the Java code formatting rules and
            templates. Other settings are provided for convenience, like disabling the console

        <para>Configuring Workspace Mechanic consists of copying a set of "rule" files to a location

                <para>Building a standalone RCE installation (which is called a "product" in Eclipse
                    RCP terms) generally consists of two steps: Providing a so-called "platform
                    repository", and then building the actual product on top of it. There are two
                    possible approaches for this:<itemizedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Using the .launch files in the "<code>using default remote
                                    repository builds</code>" sub-folder, it is possible to avoid
                                building your own platform repository, and fetch a pre-built one
                                from the main repository servers (currently hosted at DLR) instead.
                                One reason for this can be be to ensure that you are building
                                against the exact same platform repository as a certain RCE release.
                                Another reason is to simplify your local development setup if you
                                have no reason to customize the target platform setup (e.g. by
                                adding libraries).</para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>The most flexible way to build RCE from source is to compile a
                                local platform repository yourself. This is simply done by
                                navigaring to the "<code>de.rcenvironment.platform/eclipse</code>
                                folder (from the root of your workspace) and executing the single
                                .launch file that is located there. On the first run, the build
                                process may download quite a few resources from Maven Central;
                                subsequent runs should be fairly quick. Once the build has finished
                                (there should be a "SUCCESS" message near the bottom of the console
                                output), you can build the main product using the .launch files in
                                the "<code>using local repository builds</code>" sub-folder of the
                                previously mentioned location.</para>

        <title>Building from the command line</title>
        <para>Building RCE completely from the command line is somewhat complicated as it is a
            multi-step process in which later steps must reference the output artifacts of previous
            steps. To simplify this, the command-line build will be further encapsulated by
            front-end scripts, which will then be documented here. In the meantime, please use the
            steps described above to trigger the build process from Eclipse.</para>
        <para>Note that both the Eclipse-based and the command-line build trigger the same Maven
            steps in the background. Because of this, the build triggered from Eclipse produces the

            and for releases).<note>
