        <title>Usage</title>
        <para>Disable components to remove them from your integrated workflow. Use the context menu
            or select the component in the editor for dis-/enabling. Open connections will be added
            automatically to the table on the Mapping Page and can serve as inputs or outputs for the 
            integrated workflow component. Use the connection manager to delete single connections 
            in case you do not wish to disable the whole component from your workflow.</para>
        <para>Note: Components can not be added to the previous selected (sub-) workflow. Only
            enabling/disabling of components is possible. </para>
