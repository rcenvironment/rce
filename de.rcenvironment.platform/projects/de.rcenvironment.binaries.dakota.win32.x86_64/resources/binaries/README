Third-party system libraries: In addition to standard compiler and
system runtime libraries, Dakota requires the following external
third-party libraries for compilation and operation:

  BLAS/LAPACK	    BSD License, or that of compiler or system-provided libs
  Boost		    Boost Software License

GPL/Other: Dakota may optionally depend on GNU GPL-licensed
components, which are disabled by default, resulting in an
LGPL-compatible Dakota.  Optional GPL capabilities include:

 * dakota/trunk/packages/hopspack/src/src-citizens/citizen-gss/cddlib/;
   enable with CMake setting HAVE_CDDLIB.

 * dakota/packages/fftw or dakota/packages/pecos/packages/fftw:
   optionally included with Dakota; enable with CMake setting
   HAVE_FFTW

 * GNU Scientific Library: external third-party library; enable with
   CMake setting Dakota_HAVE_GSL and pointer to gsl-config

 * cURL/libcurl: external third-party library, MIT/modified-BSD
   license, but its dependencies have numerous licenses that make it
   challenging to redistribute.  Redistributed Dakota binaries never
   include libcurl.

Utilities required to compile and deploy Dakota and its documentation
are not included here.  These may include compilers, MPI, X Windows,
system runtimes, Doxygen, LaTeX, CMake, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview

The Dakota (Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale Applications) 
toolkit provides a flexible, extensible interface between analysis codes and 
iteration methods. Dakota contains algorithms for optimization with gradient 
and nongradient-based methods; uncertainty quantification with sampling, 
reliability, stochastic expansion, and epistemic methods; parameter estimation 
with nonlinear least squares methods; and sensitivity/variance analysis with 
design of experiments and parameter study capabilities.  These capabilities 
may be used on their own or as components within advanced strategies such as 
surrogate-based optimization, mixed integer nonlinear programming, or 
optimization under uncertainty.

Refer to http://dakota.sandia.gov/ for additional information,
including support contacts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distributions

Dakota is distributed in binary (executable/library) and source code
formats.  Recommendations for getting started with either format can
be found in INSTALL included with the distribution, but the most up to
date guidance can be found alongside downloads on the Dakota website.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Platforms

Dakota operates on most systems running Unix or Linux operating
systems as well as on Windows (with or without the help of a Cygwin
emulation layer).  Dakota is developed and most extensively tested on
Redhat Enterprise Linux with GNU compilers, but additional operating
systems / compiler combinations are tested nightly as well.  See the
Dakota website for more information on supported platforms for
particular Dakota versions.  Dakota was historically tested on
SGI/IRIX, DEC/OSF, and HP-UX, but these are not actively supported.
