 * Provides central access to the active {@link SystemIntegrationAdapter}. This is intended for live operation, and therefore holds a
 * singleton-style instance of the adapter.
 * <p>
 * As a side effect, it is not possible to "reset" or replace the adapter for now when testing the system monitoring services. If this is
 * ever needed, appropriate setters should be added to the service implementations to allow injecting adapter instances there, instead of
 * changing this entry point approach, as the latter may lead to confusing behavior if the old adapter is still "cached" in any services.
