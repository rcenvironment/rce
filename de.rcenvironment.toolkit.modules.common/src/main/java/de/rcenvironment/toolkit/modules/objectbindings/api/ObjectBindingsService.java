/**
 * A service providing a registry of object "bindings" for a class, and consumers consuming these bindings. Bindings are simply instances of
 * the binding class (for example, a listener interface). There can be multiple instances for the same class.
 * <p>
 * A typical use case would be a service providing a listener interface for notifications about its state. This service would register
 * itself as a consumer for the listener interface class, and any listener would register itself as a binding for the listener interface.
 * The service will then receive all listener implementations (regardless of whether they were registered before or after the service) via
 * {@link ObjectBindingsConsumer#addInstance(Object)}.
 * <p>
 * The advantages of this service over direct listener registration are:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>less coupling between the participants of the binding (implementation/consumer)
 * <li>bindings/listeners can always be registered regardless of the consumer's lifecycle
 * <li>the ability to replace the consumer for a certain binding class while maintaining the bindings setup
 * <li>better support for centralized deregistration (via {@link #removeAllBindingsOfOwner(Object)}
 * </ul>
 * .
