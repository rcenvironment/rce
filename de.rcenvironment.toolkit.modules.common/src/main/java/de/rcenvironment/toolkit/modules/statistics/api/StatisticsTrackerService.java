/**
 * Provides a central mechanism for key/counter statistics. The key space is two-layered: on the top layer, arbitrary string keys define
 * categories; below that, each category holds a key-value map with string keys and a value holder. This holder can either be a "counter",
 * which represents a simple numeric (Java "long") value, or a "value event tracker", which registers events as numerical values, and
 * collects statistics about these values (for example, minimum, average, and maximum).
 * 
 * All methods are safe for concurrent usage, in the sense that no values or events will ever be lost in the case of concurrent calls. Note
 * that, however, the generated reports are not strictly serialized with regards to concurrent counter events. This has the effect that it
 * is undefined whether a counter call that is made <b>during</b> report creation will still be reflected in that report or not. In the use
 * cases this statistics service is used for, this distinction is irrelevant, and was therefore designed for minimizing overhead instead.
